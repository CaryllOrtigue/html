TODAY AND TOMORROW
<br>
Our issue refers to our current situation which is all about pandemic.</h1>
<br><br>
<p>TODAY:</p>
<p>We attempted to compress into a single word this pandemic that made its way into our young lives and wreaked 
<p>havoc upon its wake.Through the lens of the young, I wonder how it feels to see the world somehow fall apart 
<p>through our very own eyes, seeing most of humanity struggling to fight back with this unseen threat. At such a 
<p>young and crucial point in our lives, we are experiencing a global crisis not just on health, but also on many 
<p>aspects of our society that the extent of its damaging repercussions might be too complex and complicated for 
<p>us to digest.</p>
<br>
<p>Now, as we struggle to transition from our young lives without lockdown to the ‘new normal’ with the rest of the 
<p>world, my hope is that the spirit of our resilience and the camaraderie among Filipinos and the global community 
<p>persist and win against all the forces that try to bring the whole world down. Dont lose hope, we will counterpart 
<p>this pandemic.</p>
<br>
<p>Let us stay safe, well-informed and positive as we fight hand in hand. We will get through this crisis together and 
<p>we will be multiple steps closer towards a new world with a healed humankind.</p>
<br>
<p>TOMORROW:</p>

<p>Hope a shimmer of light that gives me strength and chance</p>
<p>It is what gets me up at a time of despair </p>
<p>You are braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem,</p>
<p>And smarter than you think.</p>
<br>
<p>First and foremost, we must inculcate into our minds to stay home, unless it is truly necessary or if there are 
<p>immediate needs that must be acquired outside of our homes. Consequently, let us spread this message to our peers
<p>and also those who are within the reach of our influence. In order to flatten the curve, we must participate in 
<p>mitigating the increasing number of cases. Observe physical distance and, when you are sick, practice self-isolation 
<p>from the others. This is already a great help to combat the pandemic. So, stay home, peers! Even through this Covid-19 
<p>pandemic, we should look to God and not lose hope in him. We ne<p>ed to be using this as an opportunity and discover 
<p>the godly way of facing trials and tribulations in our own individual lives and as a community. Don't give up no matter 
<p>what cause we can surely recover we must fight for our lives. Always trust in God. Believe in His ways, remember that 
<p>we are never alone, to those people who lose hope always remember that you have a love ones. Also the best medicine is 
<p>to pray and trust in God.If you are thinking of giving up, just keep in mind that there is a rainbow after the rain. 
<p>Whatever you're experiencing now is just a trial. It will soon end and we will start a new beginning. Let's just pray 
<p>and trust Him. Good things will come soon after. Don't give up because giving up is never an option.</p>
